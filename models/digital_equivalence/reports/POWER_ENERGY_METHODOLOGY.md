# Power and Energy Methodology

- Legacy 1 MHz Pure RTL: 0.099000 W is retained as a separate low-frequency post-implementation vectorless estimate. It is not combined with the 100 MHz active-core latency, so no energy/decision is derived from it.
- Performance-matched 100 MHz Pure RTL: reportable accelerator-boundary total 0.149500 W and dynamic 0.052500 W use 100 MHz post-route real-ECG burst SAIF median; accelerator hierarchy plus allocated FPGA static. Total energy is 0.149500 W x 0.036012900 s = 0.005383928550 J/decision. Active dynamic energy is 0.052500 W x 0.036012900 s = 0.001890677250 J/decision.
- The active core latency comes from `profile_total - profile_input_wait` in each board transcript. Both operands are MEASURED 100 MHz hardware counters; the subtraction is DERIVED. It retains internal stalls and snapshot/final-decision overhead.
- Integrated system: 0.271000 W is a separate post-implementation vectorless estimate for MicroBlaze, BRAM, AXI, UART, feeder, and accelerator. Integrated compute energy is **NOT_MEASURED/NOT DERIVED** because the current BIT has neither preloaded input nor an independent system timer. Multiplying this power by the UART-paced replay interval would measure transport waiting, not integrated compute energy.
- Activity: the legacy 1 MHz and integrated MicroBlaze scopes remain vectorless. The 100 MHz accelerator result uses four real-ECG burst SAIF traces; routed-net match is approximately 12% and unmatched nets use Vivado vectorless propagation, so confidence remains Medium. Literal 1 kS/s traces are reported separately in `power/results/activity_power_summary.json`.
- Physical board power was not measured because no external power meter was available. These values must not be described as board power or measured accelerator energy.
- CPU: N/A because no RAPL/powercap or equivalent defensible counter is available.

Runtime alone is never converted into energy-efficiency speedup.
