# RTL semantics inventory

All rows refer to locked commit `c6b80de19cdcad5b7e43fe7835588b629d847f75`. “Wrap” means truncation to the declared vector width. Pulses reset low each transition unless asserted. Sequential behavior uses old state and a simultaneous next-state commit.

## Persistence summary

Feature and class-score state resets at every Snapshot start. Final prediction counts and evidence sums persist across exactly 30 Snapshots and reset at a new final inference. Physical pending registers are not public C++ state unless their old/new dependency affects a later architectural value; those dependencies are represented by held inputs, saved gate score, readout-busy count, and explicit flush transitions.
